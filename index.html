    <h2>Biographical Sketch</h2>
    <p align="justify">
	Dr. Kim is currently a staff AI software architect at Intel
	Corporation, Santa Clara, CA USA, where he drives pathfinding R&D of
	on-device AI software platform to develop AI-based system-level
	modeling and optimization. Until 2021, he worked channel analysis
	tools for signal integrity and power integrity solutions for VLSI
	high-speed I/O interconnect. He has authored or co-authored more than
	thirty papers in scientific papers and one book publication about
	machine learning-based dynamic resource management in 2019. Since
	2020, he has worked as a standard committee of IEEE P1924.1, which
	recently officially standardized in IEEE. He has been an associate
	editor of Integration, the VLSI Journal, and a TPC of major VLSI
	conferences since 2017 for DAC/ISLPED/ASP-DAC.</p>
	  
    <p align="justify">He has received the M.S. degree in electrical
      engineering from <a href="http://www.virginia.edu">University of
      Virginia</a>, Charlottesville, VA, USA in 2012, and the
      Ph.D. degree in computer science
      from <a href="http://www.ucr.edu">University of California</a>,
      Riverside, CA, USA in 2017. His dissertation was titled
      "<a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/9tc8w0b9"><em>System-level
      Electromigration-Induced Dynamic Reliability
      Management</em></a>."  During his Ph.D. study, he received a
      best research award at ACM Ph.D. Forum at Design Automation
      Conference (DAC) in 2015 and a dissertation award from the
      University of California in 2017.</p>

          ed. Springer International Publishing, 2019
          
          <br>This book provides readers with a detailed reference
          regarding two of the most important long-term reliability
          and aging effects on nanometer integrated systems,
          electromigrations (EM) for interconnect and biased
          temperature instability (BTI) for CMOS devices. Dr. Kim has
          been focusing on <b>machine learning-based dynamic resource
          management</b> algorithm and this book includes his full doctoral research.
